### Detailed Workflow Steps

#### 🔍 **Phase 1: Stock Selection (You Must Do This)**
TradingAgents cannot help with this phase. You need to:

```mermaid
graph TB
    A[Stock Selection Tools] --> B[Finviz Screener]
    A --> C[Yahoo Finance Screener]
    A --> D[Broker Platform Tools]
    A --> E[Financial News]

    C --> G
    D --> G
    E --> G
    F --> G
    
    G --> H[AAPL, TSLA, NVDA, GOOGL...]
```

**Recommended Tools for Stock Selection**:
- **Finviz**: Advanced stock screener with technical and fundamental filters
- **Yahoo Finance Screener**: Free basic screening tools

- **Analyst Reports**: Professional research recommendations

**Example Selection Criteria**:
```
✅ Market cap > $1B
✅ P/E ratio < 25
✅ Revenue growth > 10%
✅ Strong technical momentum
✅ Positive analyst sentiment
```

#### 🧠 **Phase 2: Deep Analysis (TradingAgents)**
For each stock in your watchlist:

```python
# Example: Analyze your pre-selected stocks
watchlist = ["AAPL", "TSLA", "NVDA", "GOOGL"]
analysis_date = "2024-01-15"
results = {}

for ticker in watchlist:
    print(f"Analyzing {ticker}...")
    final_state, decision = ta.propagate(ticker, analysis_date)
    results[ticker] = {
        "decision": decision,
        "analysis": final_state["final_trade_decision"],
        "confidence": final_state.get("confidence_score", "N/A")
    }

# Review results
for ticker, result in results.items():
    print(f"{ticker}: {result['decision']}")
```

    print(f"\n=== Analyzing {ticker} ===")
    final_state, decision = ta.propagate(ticker, analysis_date)
    
    # Extract key information
    results[ticker] = {
        "decision": decision,
        "reasoning": final_state["final_trade_decision"],
        "market_analysis": final_state["market_report"],
        "risk_assessment": final_state["risk_debate_state"]["judge_decision"]
    }
    
    print(f"{ticker} Recommendation: {decision}")

# Compare results
print("\n=== Summary ===")
for ticker, result in results.items():
    print(f"{ticker}: {result['decision']}")
```

```

### Common Usage Patterns

#### Pattern 1: Weekly Watchlist Review
```python
# Every Sunday, analyze your watchlist
watchlist = ["AAPL", "GOOGL", "MSFT", "TSLA"]
current_date = "2024-01-15"

weekly_analysis = {}
for ticker in watchlist:
    _, decision = ta.propagate(ticker, current_date)
    weekly_analysis[ticker] = decision

# Track changes from previous week
print("Weekly Analysis Summary:")
for ticker, decision in weekly_analysis.items():
    print(f"{ticker}: {decision}")
```

#### Pattern 2: Event-Driven Analysis
```python
# Analyze stocks around earnings or major events
earnings_stocks = ["AAPL", "TSLA"]  # Companies reporting earnings
event_date = "2024-01-15"  # Day before earnings

for ticker in earnings_stocks:
    print(f"\nPre-earnings analysis for {ticker}")
    final_state, decision = ta.propagate(ticker, event_date)
    
    # Focus on risk assessment before events
    risk_analysis = final_state["risk_debate_state"]["judge_decision"]
    print(f"Risk Assessment: {risk_analysis}")
```

#### Pattern 3: Sector Rotation Analysis
```python
# Compare stocks from different sectors
tech_stocks = ["AAPL", "GOOGL", "MSFT"]
healthcare_stocks = ["JNJ", "PFE", "UNH"]
finance_stocks = ["JPM", "BAC", "WFC"]

sectors = {
    "Technology": tech_stocks,
    "Healthcare": healthcare_stocks,
    "Finance": finance_stocks
}

analysis_date = "2024-01-15"
sector_results = {}

for sector, stocks in sectors.items():
    sector_results[sector] = {}
    for ticker in stocks:
        _, decision = ta.propagate(ticker, analysis_date)
        sector_results[sector][ticker] = decision

# Compare sector performance
for sector, results in sector_results.items():
    buy_count = sum(1 for decision in results.values() if decision == "BUY")
    print(f"{sector}: {buy_count}/{len(results)} BUY recommendations")
```

## 🌍 Market Applicability: Stocks vs Forex vs Other Assets

### 🎯 **Designed for Stock Markets**

TradingAgents is **specifically designed for equity (stock) analysis** and is **NOT suitable for forex trading** in its current form.

### ❌ **Why TradingAgents is NOT Suitable for Forex Trading**

#### 1. **Missing Critical Forex Data Sources**
```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "❌ Stock Data (Not Relevant for Forex)"
        A[Company Financial Statements]
        B[Insider Trading Data]
        C[Corporate News]
        D[Earnings Reports]
    end
    
    subgraph "✅ Forex Needs (Not Available)"
        E[Central Bank Policies]
        F[Economic Indicators]

    end
    
    style A fill:#ffebee
    style B fill:#ffebee
    style C fill:#ffebee
    style D fill:#ffebee
```

**Forex markets require data that TradingAgents doesn't have**:
- ❌ **Central Bank Policies**: Interest rate decisions, monetary policy statements
- ❌ **Economic Indicators**: GDP, CPI, employment data, PMI
- ❌ **Political Events**: Elections, policy changes, geopolitical tensions
- ❌ **Commodity Correlations**: Oil, gold prices affecting currencies
- ❌ **Capital Flows**: International money movement data

#### 2. **Wrong Analysis Framework**
```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Stock Analysis Framework (Current)"
        A[Company Fundamentals]
        B[Industry Analysis]
        C[Financial Health]

    style B fill:#ffebee
    style C fill:#ffebee
    style D fill:#ffebee
    style E fill:#ffebee
```

#### 3. **Inappropriate Agent Roles**
Current agents are designed for stock analysis:

| Current Agent | Stock Focus | Forex Limitation |
|---------------|-------------|------------------|
| **Fundamentals Analyst** | Company financial statements | ❌ No company in forex pairs |
| **Social Media Analyst** | Stock discussions on Reddit | ❌ Different forex discussion patterns |
| **News Analyst** | Company-specific news | ❌ Needs macroeconomic news |
| **Market Analyst** | Stock technical indicators | ⚠️ Limited - only technical analysis works |

### ⚠️ **Limited Technical Analysis Capability**

**What MIGHT work for forex**:
```python
# Technical indicators could theoretically work
ta.propagate("EURUSD=X", "2024-01-15")  # EUR/USD analysis
ta.propagate("GBPUSD=X", "2024-01-15")  # GBP/USD analysis

# Might provide:
# ✅ RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands
# ✅ Moving averages
# ✅ Support/resistance levels
```

**What WON'T work for forex**:
```python
final_state["fundamentals_report"]  # ❌ No fundamental data
final_state["sentiment_report"]     # ❌ Wrong sentiment sources
final_state["news_report"]          # ❌ Company news irrelevant
```

### 🔧 **What Would Be Needed for Forex Support**

#### Required Data Sources
```python
forex_data_sources = {
    "economic_calendar": "Major economic events and releases",
    "central_banks": "Fed, ECB, BOJ, BOE policy decisions",
    "macro_indicators": "GDP, inflation, employment data",
    "political_events": "Elections, policy changes",
    "commodity_prices": "Oil, gold affecting currencies",
    "capital_flows": "International money movements"
}
```

#### Required Agent Redesign
```python
forex_agents = [
    "macro_economist",        # GDP, inflation, employment analysis
    "central_bank_analyst",   # Monetary policy interpretation
    "geopolitical_analyst",   # Political events and stability
    "commodity_analyst",      # Oil, gold correlation analysis
    "flow_analyst",          # Capital flow and sentiment
    "technical_analyst"       # Price action and indicators
]
```

#### Required Analysis Framework
